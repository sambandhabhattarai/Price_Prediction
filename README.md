**Housing Price Prediction using Machine Learning**

This project focuses on predicting housing prices using different regression techniques. The dataset used is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. After experimenting with multiple regression models, Random Forest Regressor was selected as the best performing model for predicting housing prices.

****Project Overview**

The main goal of this project is to build a regression model that can accurately predict the prices of houses based on various features such as:

Crime rate

Average number of rooms

Property tax rate

Distance to employment centers

And other relevant attributes

The project walks through the following stages:

Data collection and exploration

Data preprocessing

Feature selection

Model building with various regression algorithms

Model evaluation and comparison

Final model selection and prediction

üèÜ **Why Random Forest Regressor?**

After comparing models using evaluation metrics such as:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)



**The Random Forest Regressor outperformed other models by achieving**:

Higher accuracy

Better generalization on unseen data

Lower error rates
